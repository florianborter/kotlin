	<h2 class="accordion">Omicron: WHO concerned rich countries could hoard vaccines</h2>
	<article>
		<p>
			The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concern that wealthy countries will start to hoard Covid
			vaccines in response to the rapid spread of the new Omicron variant. It said this could threaten supplies to
			nations where most people are still unvaccinated. Some rich countries are accelerating the roll-out of a
			booster shot in response to Omicron. There are concerns that vaccines are less effective against the
			variant.
		</p>
		<p>
			Recent studies of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine showed it produced far fewer neutralising antibodies against
			Omicron than against the original strain, but that this deficit could be reversed by the booster. However,
			the WHO says administering primary doses should be the priority.
		</p>
		<p>
			WHO vaccine director Kate O'Brien urged richer nations to continue donating vaccine doses and shipments to
			underserved countries to address what had become a dangerous inequity in access. "As we head into whatever
			the Omicron situation is going to be, there is risk that the global supply is
			again going to revert to high-income countries hoarding vaccines," she said.

	<h2 class="accordion">Beijing Winter Olympics boycott is insignificant, says Macron</h2>
	<article>
		<p>
			France has no plans to join a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, President Emmanuel
			Macron has said. Mr Macron said any such move would be insignificant and merely symbolic.
		</p>
		<p>
			The US, UK, Canada and Australia have said they will not send government representatives to the February
			games because of concerns over China's human rights record. This includes allegations of abuse against
			Uyghurs and other minorities.
		</p>
		<p>
			Relations are also strained over a crackdown on political freedoms in Hong Kong and concerns about Chinese
			tennis player Peng Shuai, who was not seen for weeks after she accused a top government official of sexual
			assault.
		</p>
		<p>
			China says countries that boycott the games "will pay the price for their mistaken acts". Meanwhile United
			Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he had accepted an invitation to attend the
			opening of the games.

	<h2 class="accordion">New Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations</h2>
	<article>
		<p>
			New Zealand will ban the sale of tobacco to its next generation, in a bid to eventually phase out smoking.
			Anyone born after 2008 will not be able to buy cigarettes or tobacco products in their lifetime, under a law
			expected to be enacted next year. "We want to make sure young people never start smoking," Health Minister
			Dr Ayesha Verall said. The move is part of a sweeping crackdown on smoking announced by New Zealand's health
			ministry on Thursday.
		</p>
		<p>
			Doctors and other health experts in the country have welcomed the "world-leading" reforms, which will reduce
			access to tobacco and restrict nicotine levels in cigarettes. "It will help people quit or switch to less
			harmful products, and make it much less likely that young people
			get addicted to nicotine," said Prof Janet Hook from the University of Otago.
		</p>
		<p>
			The crackdown has been met with mixed reactions.
